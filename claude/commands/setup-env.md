# /setup-env – Set up Python environment for mmWave fall demo

You are helping the user set up this project locally.

1. Assume they have **Python 3.10+** and **Isaac Sim / Omniverse** already installed.
2. Explain, in concise steps, how to:

   - Create and activate a virtual environment in the current project directory
   - Install `requirements.txt`
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and explain the key variables

3. Then output the exact shell commands in a single fenced code block, ready to paste into a terminal.
4. Do **not** try to install Isaac Sim with `pip`. Just mention that it must be installed separately.
